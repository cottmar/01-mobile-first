# Cara- Joanna

**Author**: Cara Ottmar and Joanna Coll
**Version**: 2.0.0 

## Overview
We are building a blog that will have articles about various topics by various authors. It is important to build the blog "mobile first" but also have it be dynamic depending on screen size. 


## Getting Started
The user will need to:
1. create html and add links to JS and CSS
2. populate the CSS 
3. Build content and have JS interaction


## Architecture
We used HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS.
